               <p>Athletes and exercise junkies have gone mad for protein shakes and supplements over the past few years, with sales expected to reach £8bn over the next five years worldwide. The appeal of these products is that they claim to increase muscle strength, function and size, and although they’re largely consumed by 20-something men trying to bulk up for the summer before putting on a t-shirt a size too small to show off their hard work, they can definitely have a place in a healthy lifestyle.</p>
